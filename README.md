# Guidelines (WIP)

These design principles are opiniated, but created by all of us.

## Ethics

We recognise that a poor implementation of the solution could create resentment and cause societal division.The solution will be designed to respect the needs of vulnerable groups within society. The ethical frame is drawn from the Belmont Report guidelines which address the protection of human subjects in biomedical and behavioural research:

- Respect for persons: protecting the autonomy of all people and treating them with courtesy and respect and allowing for informed consent;
- Beneficence: The philosophy of "Do no harm" while maximising benefits for participants and minimising risks to them; and
- Justice: ensuring reasonable, non-exploitative, and well-considered procedures are administered fairly and equally.
